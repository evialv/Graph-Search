## Hospital Distribution ##
## K Centers Problem ##
Our goal was to find the best possible distribution of hospitals in a given area such as the maximum patiant's distance from the nearest hospital would be the minimum.</br>
This is an NP-Hard problem so we only found the best estimate we could.</br>
We implemented the following:
* Brute Force Algorithm for k-centers
* Greedy Algorithm for k-centers
* Our Algorithm implementation for the k-centers 
### Our Algorithm implementation for the k-centers problem was awarded as the best scoring one in the entire class. ###
